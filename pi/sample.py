sample_text = """It is a widely held view that positive genetic engineering should in principle be ruled out. This belief, when combined with the view that it is acceptable to use genetic engineering to remedy defects, depends upon a distinction that is not completely sharp. But, assuming that some such distinction can at least roughly be drawn, some of the arguments against any positive engineering have been criticized.
The arguments designed to show that overall improvement is unlikely need not deter us. Some are difficulties for eugenic breeding policies, which need not apply to genetic engineering. Others appeal to a principle we need not believe in: that genetic gains will always be balanced by compensating losses.
The need to protect family relationships creates a presumption that any genetic change should be brought about gradually. But this point, like other arguments for caution, should be placed in the context of the genetic changes which are taking place anyway, sometimes as the unintended results of policies of ours.
The disadvantages of cloning batches of people create a presumption against that policy. Our resistance to crossing species boundaries may be largely irrational, though in the case of mixing human and other genes, there may be dangers in undermining our resistance. But the dominating reason for caution about adopting positive human genetic engineering, as well as for gradualness if we do adopt it, is the risk of some irreversible disaster. Even this risk has only been interpreted here as justifying a principle of caution rather than a total ban. Like all the objections considered so far, it is a matter of setting losses or risks against any possible benefits. Because all these objections have been of this kind, they are all, from the theoretical point of view, relatively clear. They are in some cases important, but most of them raise few deep issues not already present in debates on other possibly hazardous technology, or in debates on large scale social changes. The set of problems which raises deeper issues centres round the question: if we adopt positive genetic engineering, who is in a position to decide what future people should be like?"""
